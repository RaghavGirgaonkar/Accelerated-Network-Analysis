%Y = STATGAUSSNOISEGEN(N,PSD,O,Fs)
%Generates a realization Y of stationary gaussian noise with a target
%2-sided power spectral density given by PSD. Fs is the sampling frequency
%of Y. PSD is an M-by-2 matrix containing frequencies and the corresponding
%PSD values in the first and second columns respectively. The frequencies
%must start from 0 and end at Fs/2. The order of the FIR filter to be used
%is given by O.
